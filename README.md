ðŸ§  Decoding Maths Beyond Algorithms â€“ A Journey Through Real Life with Numbers

This repo is a collection of simple yet fascinating blogs exploring the math behind real-life patterns, games, and everyday situations â€” not just formulas, but the intuition behind them.

Guided and mentored by Shubham Sir (IIT-BHU alum, Super30 alum, an explorer, and lifelong learner), Iâ€™ve been inspired to see math beyond textbooks â€” as a lens to understand the world.

No heavy algorithms here â€” just relatable stories, fun observations, and curious questions driven by basic math.


ðŸ“š What to expect:

>The math behind everyday patterns

>Logic behind games and decisions

>Numbers that narrate real stories

Letâ€™s make math less scary, more friendly â€” and absolutely worth exploring.
Will try to decode atleast 4-5 logics in a month.
Stay tuned. Letâ€™s decode math, one story at a time.
